Welcome to RAID BOSS! An interavtive way to cooperatively play commander with the homies.

This is currently a text based application but we hope to involve graphiocs at a later date.
Probably TKinter first- sorry.

The boss monster has 250X life (ex. 2X = 2 times the number of players in the game). 
50X poison is required to defeat the boss monster. Each turn, roll 2d6 per the turn number divided by 2,
 rounded down. For hard mode, roll 2d6 per the turn number. The boss monster has infinite mana to pay 
for tax effects (like Rhystic Study or Windborn Muse) that affect its attacks or casting of spells and its 
spells can always be cast, although they can be countered. 
The boss monster has a regular turn structure and its spells are cast during its first main phase as sorceries. 
Players can block for each other.
